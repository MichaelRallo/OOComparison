# Language Purpose/Genesis
[Back to Home](README.md)
## Java
### Why was the language created?
Java was initially created in 1991, with the goal of working with interactive television. However, it soon advanced too far to be useful in that regard. 
### What problems was the language trying to address?
Java's main goal was to become as portable, in the sense that it could run on as many different kinds of systems as possible. It's original slogan was "Write Once, Run Anywhere". Oracle also lists five main goals that lead to the creation of Java:  

1. It must be "simple, object-oriented, and familiar".   
2. It must be "robust and secure".  
3. It must be "architecture-neutral and portable".  
4. It must execute with "high performance".  
5. It must be "interpreted, threaded, and dynamic".  
### Is the language a reaction to a previous language or a replacement for another language?
Java was an attempt to make a universal language, and didn't really have a competitor for that role at the time. However, it was designed with C/C++ notation in mind, so that programmers would find it easy to migrate to. 
## C++
### Why was the language created?
The language was initially created to have the design aspects of languages used for large software development, while maintaining the speed of lower level languages. Basically, making OO design applicable with a lower level language.
### What problems was the language trying to address?
C++ was created in order to build on the C language, and give it design features that would allow applications to be more sustainable. C was chosen because it was quick and widely used. 
### Is the language a reaction to a previous language or a replacement for another language?
C++ was built on top of C, in order to allow for the development of much larger applications that ran quicker. This may not have been with the intention of being a replacement of C, since that still was more ideal for the quickest application possible.
