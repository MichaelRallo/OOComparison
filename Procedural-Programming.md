# Procedural Programming
[Back to Home](README.md)
#### Does the language support procedural programming?
Overall, this is a tricky question because of the broadness of the terms. If we are being extremely pedantic, nearly every language can be described as having some degree of procedural qualities, by having an operation equivalent to a function. However, I'm going to restrict my look at this to if they can be structured in the traditional manner of having code be the primary feature, and not data/objects. 

## Java
Java does not support procedural programming, and was made to be entirely OO based. 

## C++
C++ has support for both OO and procedural code structures. The creator of C++, Bjarne Stroustrup, started it's development under the name "C With Classes". Since C is very much a procedural language, this was a big push into the OO world to allow it to have classes. In the end, C++ ended up being able to support both design models.
